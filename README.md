# Presentation
This project contains the CUDA and C++ implementations of "Algorithm 1" in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00806
# Abstract
We provide a GPU-friendly algorithm for obtaining all weak pseudo-manifolds whose facets are all in an input set of facets satisfying given conditions. We use it here to completely list up toric colorable seed PL-spheres with a few vertices implying the complete characterization of PL-spheres of dimension nâˆ’1 with n+4 vertices having maximal Buchstaber numbers.
# Content
The ./Data folder gathers the input facets for all the necessary dimensions n-1, one for each IDCM orbit.
